## Welcome to the sunaj/purec repo
The aim is to publish snippets of C code that are each fully functional and can easily be extended and worked on as needed

### For now the list is short:
* **File Explorer Quick Terminal** - this one file no lib Win11 utility serves the purpose of linking F1 (or indeed any F1-12 key) so that
  when pressed within File Explorer the current folder will be opened in the default Terminal ("wt") set within Win11. I use Terminal
  Preview myself but any recent version of Powershell should be linked to the wt shortcut as needed. The utility has a few ergonomic
  cmdline params that can be parsed on startup, see helpfile as needed.
